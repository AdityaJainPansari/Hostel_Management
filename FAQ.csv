"What about curfew for students in IIIT Hyderabad?","Usually, no one gives a shit ! Authorities go rabid only if there are accidents or other 'kaands' (IYKWIM) in or around the campus. At any given point of time from 8PM to 6 AM you will definitely find at least 3-4 IIITian ( sometime even Profs.) at the food stalls near the  DLF building nearby or near the 'Bonde-waali-aunty.'"
"Comment on Room qualities in IIIT-H Hostels?","Block D and E of OBH are very good. NBH is good too. OBH old rooms are a bit disappointing after D and E blocks in the 1st and 2nd years. However you get used to it."
"How good are the nearby locations at IIIT to live in the Hostels ?","IIIT is located very close to Gachibowli market.  Many good food joints are present there. Almost all of them provide home-delivery service. This adds even more zing to the campus life.  I remember  the Dominoes and subway guys delivering 60 orders way after their closing times. No way they are going to miss earning easy 9000 bucks. ( each order is about Rs 150/-) from their most regular customers."
"Are Rooftops open for residents?","Roofs of the OBH are locked. However most of the times Yoga-room top is unlocked ( People haven't done any 'kaand' over there yet.)  If you want even more fun. ECE-top is the best place. Going on the roof there was easy once, now its a bit tough. Lot of construction and guard patrolling. Not a big issue if you try hard.\nHowever, the best place is the new faculty quarters rooftops. A thief doesn't look under his own pillow. There were no gates to the rooftops at least 1 year  ago. I am not sure about it now."
"How good is the Hostel Administration?","Don't fuck with them. Don't play loud music if your room is near the main gate of the hostel. If you don't bother them, they will not bother you. I have met the hostel admin only twice every year, only during the start of every semester."
"Any other stuff to lead a good life at IIIT?","Respect the people who work at the yellow-box and the juice stall. (you'll know more about the yellow box if you come to IIIT). Avoid cheating them when paying your dues. They will save your life when nothing else works. There is no night canteen at IIIT. These people will provide you with the essential Parle-G, cold-coffee, mosambi and banana juice when the mess is closed and you haven't eaten anything for the past 1-2 days. You can fuck with the faculty, you can fuck with the hostel admins, you can fuck with other students, you can fuck with the guards, you can fuck anyone you like; but if you fuck with anyone from the yellow-box or the juice stall,  you lose respect among your peers instantly."
